# FlexFX - Flexible Sound-effect Recipes
Many microbit projects can be brought to life by adding sound-effects to indicate their state.

The ``||music:Music||`` category has a ``||music:micro:bit(V2)||`` section with blocks for **sound-expressions**. 
These let you build some amazing sounds, but sometimes you need something a bit more complex.

A ``||flexFX:flexFX||`` provides a "sound journey", following a sonic path through time that 
flows smoothly between fixed [pitch, volume] points, simultaneously tracking the pitch-profile 
and the volume-profile. It stitches together multiple sound-expressions to be played one after the 
other, giving a smoothly varying result.
